# Hangman-Game

Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers, within a certain number of guesses.

In this adoption of the game, the computer will give the game which the player has to guess. If the player guesses the word correctly he/she wins and the score goes up by 1, the game will also play a celebratory music for the player. If the player is unable to guess the word in 10 attempts he loses in which case the game will be reset by pressing ENTER key.

Have Fun Playing.
